        "upright": "The Emperor brings powerful stability and structure to your romantic life, embodying the archetype of the protective provider who takes commitment seriously. This card suggests a relationship built on solid foundations, where loyalty, security, and clear boundaries create a safe space for love to flourish. Whether you're seeking or already have a partner, expect someone who demonstrates their affection through actions, responsibility, and unwavering dedication.",
        "reversed": "Control issues and power struggles may be undermining the harmony in your relationship, with one partner dominating or imposing rigid expectations on the other. Emotional unavailability or an overly authoritarian approach to love can create distance and resentment, stifling the natural flow of intimacy. This reversal calls for examining whether fear or ego is preventing genuine vulnerability and emotional connection."

    "career": {
        "upright": "You are stepping into a position of authority and leadership, where your organizational skills, strategic thinking, and ability to create structure will lead to significant professional achievements. The Emperor represents mastery over your domain, suggesting that discipline, clear goals, and a methodical approach will establish you as a respected figure in your field. This is an excellent time for taking on leadership roles, starting your own business, or implementing systems that bring order to chaos.",
        "reversed": "Excessive rigidity, micromanagement, or abuse of power may be creating a toxic work environment that stifles creativity and innovation. You might be encountering an overly controlling boss, struggling with bureaucratic red tape, or finding that strict adherence to rules is preventing progress. Consider whether you're being too inflexible in your approach or whether it's time to challenge oppressive structures that no longer serve growth."
    },
    "spirituality": {
        "upright": "Spiritual growth flourishes when paired with discipline, structure, and consistent practice, as the Emperor reminds us that enlightenment requires dedication and a solid framework. Establish clear rituals, honor traditions that resonate with you, and approach your spiritual path with the same commitment you would bring to mastering any important skill. This card encourages you to be the architect of your own spiritual journey, building a foundation that can weather any storm.",
        "reversed": "Rigid dogma or authoritarian spiritual beliefs may be constraining your authentic expression and preventing true spiritual evolution. The reversed Emperor suggests it's time to question inherited belief systems, break free from spiritual authorities who demand blind obedience, and embrace a more flexible, personal approach to the divine. Liberation comes from honoring your own inner wisdom rather than submitting to external rules that feel oppressive."
